Your Timing Analysis
For WNS = +0.249 ns (Period = 20.5 ns):

F_max = 1 / 20.5 ns = 48.78 MHz  ✓ (constraint MET, design works)
For WNS = -0.259 ns (Period = 20 ns):

F_max = 1 / (20 + 0.259) = 1 / 20.259 ns = 49.36 MHz  ✗ (constraint VIOLATED)
So your true F_max = 48.78 MHz (use the 20.5 ns constraint result).

Throughput of Your Holt-Winters Design
Looking at your VHDL, this is not a pipelined design — it's an FSM-based iterative design. So throughput = how many clock cycles to process one full batch of 60 samples and produce 12 forecasts.

Cycle Count Per State
State	Cycles
S_COLLECT	60 (one per valid_in)
S_INIT_L	12
S_INIT_T	12
S_INIT_SAVG	12 × 5 = 60
S_INIT_S	5 × 12 = 60
S_UPDATE + S_UPDATE_WAIT	60 × 2 = 120
S_FORECAST	12
S_DONE	1
Total cycles = 60 + 12 + 12 + 60 + 60 + 120 + 12 + 1 = 337 cycles

Throughput Calculation
Time per batch = 337 cycles / 48.78 MHz = 6.91 µs

Throughput = 60 samples / 6.91 µs = 8.68 M samples/sec

Forecast rate = 12 forecasts / 6.91 µs = 1.737 M forecasts/sec
Since each sample is 32 bits (Q16.16):

Data throughput = 8.68M × 32 bits = 277.7 Mbps
